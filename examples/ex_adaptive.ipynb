    "This notebook shows how `neffint.fourier_integral_fixed_sampling` can be used to calculate fourier integrals. This function is well suited for computing the fourier integrals of functions on a already defined frequency grid which captures all important features of the function to be transformed. More precisely, interpolating the function over the the given frequencies should give an interpolating polynomial which closely approximates the function itself."
